         (a) rule client is more important than own; if a rule does not have a client, folder should not also have it 
         (b) parent client is more importat than own client
        The method is hierarcically recursive
        IMPORTANT: it is critical to order self hierarhicly to calculate firtsly the parents and only then - children

         * actually the order of parent_client_id & rule_client id is not important, since rules have the same
           recursion logic, whilerule-related folders cannot be children to not rule-related ones. 
           However, for emergent cases it is preferable to apply the parent rule first, since it migth be also
           rule-related
         * manual folders within rule-related folders however might be moved to another parent and might be changed,
           so, in case parent folder does not have a client, it might be synced to any
         * clear_caches does not fully guarantee recursive update so we apply inverse on own_client_id and rule

            1. Model-related folder - so, cumulative directories for object-related folders.  
            2. Object-related folder - so, of an Odoo record
        E.g. Contacts > John > Tasks > Task1: "Contacts" & "Tasks" are rule-related; "John" & "Task1" are object-related

        1. Model-related folders:
            a. Do not have linked res_id and res_model
            b. Should/Might be changed only in case if they related to the same rule and the same parent
               Otherwise, a brand new directory should be created.
               E.g. Contacts > John > Tasks (id=1) > Task1 is incorrect to make Contacts > Mike > Tasks (id=1) > Task1
               Instead, it should be Contacts > Mike > Tasks (id=2) > Task1. In that example, Tasks (id=1) would be 
               still linked to John and would have the same items.
            c. Odoo model <> model-related folder has one2many relations. Each model might have a few linked directories
        2. Oject-related folders:
            a. Always have res_model and res_id, so it is linked to an Odoo document
            b. Should/Might be changed disregarding parent and rule
               E.g. Contacts > John > Tasks  > Task1(id=1) ==> Porjects > Task1(id=1)
               Files related to Task1 would be passed together with an object
            c. Odoo Object <> Object-related folder has a one2one2 relation. There might be not a few folders for the 
               same Odoo object. It is placed to the parent which order is the highest (recursively)

        In such a way, the relation object-related folder > model-related folder is always the kept (John > Tasks)
        The relation model-related folder > object-related  folder is not kept (Contacts > John)
