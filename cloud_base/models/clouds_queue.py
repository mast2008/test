    The model which represents an each sync task

     * We do not delete tasks but deactivate those for:
       ** to avoid continius clouds.queue unlink logger (impossible to remove without monkey patching)
       ** to provide better compute triggering, since depends on tasks_ids.active is better than just o2m table  
     * Sequence is used to block tasks with bigger sequence (not for ordering!)
       The idea is that tasks with higher sequence might be anyway processed if they are not blocked
       For example, task 1 (sequence 0) blocks task 2 (sequence 10), but task 3 (sequence 10) is not blocked.
       Thus, if the task 3 had lesser ID, it would be processed earlier than task 1.
       Sequence is also used to block child folder tasks: if there is any task with sequence lesser than 100, child tasks
       tasks cannot be processed.
